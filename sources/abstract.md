## Abstract

There is a strong demand for accessible recreational sports, yet many people struggle to find others to play with, often relying on ad hoc group chats or word-of-mouth, which are inefficient and exclude newcomers. This project proposes **HopOn**, a mobile application that connects individuals interested in sports such as badminton, tennis, and basketball, making it easier to discover, organize, and join local pickup games. The objective is to lower barriers to organizing matches, improve participation rates, and make recreational sports more inclusive for students, young professionals, and casual athletes. HopOn will feature location-based search, scheduling, and group management tools, supported by a backend for user accounts and game listings and an intuitive frontend for participation. Unlike alternatives like WhatsApp groups, Facebook communities, or Meetup, HopOn provides a focused, sport-specific platform with smarter filters and streamlined coordination. Expected results include increased game frequency, stronger community ties, and improved physical and mental well-being, demonstrated through user testing, retention metrics, and pilot trials in local communities.  

## Mini Project 1

In Mini Project One, our team established the foundational infrastructure and conducted preliminary research for HopOn:

**Team Infrastructure & Communication:**
- Set up Discord server for team communication
- Configured Linear for project management and task tracking
- Established weekly team meetings and sprint cycles
- Created GitHub repository for version control and collaboration

**Development Progress:**
- Developed MVP frontend with multiple pages implemented
- Created Figma mockups for user interface design
- Researched and evaluated potential technology architectures

**Market Research & Validation:**
- Conducted initial market research to validate demand
- Performed user interviews to understand pain points
- Analyzed competitive landscape (WhatsApp groups, Facebook communities, Meetup)

## Mini Project 2

Building on our Mini Project One foundation, we will significantly expand HopOn's capabilities:

**Core Development:**
- Complete full-stack MVP implementation (frontend, backend, and database)
- Implement user authentication and account management system
- Develop location-based search and filtering functionality
- Build game creation, scheduling, and management features
- Create group coordination and participation tools

**User Validation & Iteration:**
- Conduct user testing sessions with target demographic (students, young professionals, casual athletes)
- Gather feedback through pilot trials in local communities
- Iterate on design and functionality based on user insights
- Measure key metrics (user retention, game frequency, participation rates)
